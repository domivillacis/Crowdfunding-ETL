# Crowdfunding ETL

## Project overview
This analysis consists of helping Independent Funding, a crowdfunding platform, to move their data from a large excel file to a PostgreSQL database.

To do this, we are going to use the ETL (Extract, Transform and Load) process that will help us clean and transform raw data into readable files and work on them with SQL.


## Results
As we can see in the following images, the data can come in different formats, the important thing is to be able to organize this data in order to draw relevant conclusions for stakeholders.

Once we have the information organized, SQL allows us to create diagrams, databases and tables to generate relationships between them and find specific results.

Finally, we can import or better yet, export the created tables as files with the new results, for a more optimal analysis. In this case, we created new databases to send an email to Independent Funding contacts and backers, to let them know what is their remaining goal amount, so they can work more efficiently on their campaigns.
